            The StudentConnect app’s name was conceived during a social
            media-driven research phase, reflecting the inclusive and
            communicative spirit of the platform.

            As I delved into the UI design, the initial concept was to mirror
            the app’s objective of clear and accessible guidance for students.

            However, user feedback steered me towards a more universal design
            and ensured that the interface remained approachable across
            different demographics, for a design that’s not only functional but
            also resonates with our global audience on a visual and practical
            level.

            App’s climactic iteration came to me clearly and intentionally over
            the following days. There was a main mission I felt compelled to
            accomplish in the final design.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            StudentConnect needed to be highly accessible, both visually and
            figuratively, to a wide range of users all over the globe.

          <br />

            Finally, The design evolved to become more than a mere repository of
            information, or for resources—it can now be used as a vibrant
            community hub, a gathering place for students from various
            backgrounds to connect, share, and lead a easy life in the college.
